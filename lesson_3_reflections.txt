1 When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

my answer : if there are more than one developers, or if i can use different computers, i would want to use a remote repository.
and probably it can be more secure.


2 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

my answer : for now, i have no idea. maybe it can be about if some other developer changed the file i was working on, i would like to do pull changes
manually and control it.


3 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

my answer : fork is available between github accounts. when we you want to clone a repository, you can fork it.
clone gets the repository from github to your local, then you can use git commands. when you need an experimental change or a risky one 
you could create a new branch and use it for your crazy changes.


4 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

my answer : it could decrease possible conflicts.
