1 When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

my answer : if there are more than one developers, or if i can use different computers, i would want to use a remote repository.
and probably it can be more secure.


2 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

my answer : for now, i have no idea. maybe it can be about if some other developer changed the file i was working on, i would like to do pull changes
manually and control it.
